#########################################################################
# This script checks OpenVPNs index.txt for how much time is left
# until a client certificate will be expired.
# Certificats with OpenSSL maximum (999999) are excluded.
# Time should be configured by the individual needs,
# but is currently configured to 5 days.
#
# Days before can be defined in the "ALERT=5" variable.
# An own Email account should be presant for this since the Email account
#     password are stored in cleartext in the script.
# Script provides Email encryption via GPG.
#     An howto setup can be found in here --> http://wiki.ipfire.org/en/optimization/scripts/gpg/start .
# Email function is currently commented to check the script functionality.
# Own Email credentials needs to be set in the script (section herefor are marked).
# Clean up $WORKDIR in /tmp is currently commented to investigate file results.
# Script can be placed e.g. into /etc/fcron.daily .
#     All paths has been set absolute so the fcron environment should find all binaries.
